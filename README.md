The idea behind "Pareshaan" is to build a ridiculously simple bug server for projects.

### We want to 

- Be a solution for a small project, which are starting up with a small number of users. 
- Take away all bulky details from the bugs, and just stick to the basics.
- Simple text based bug format, that allows users to write bugs and upload it from anywhere.
- Easy backup of all bug data, and ability to bring up another instance with same data with ease.
- Ability to export bugs to csv, and json files.

### We don't want to

- Be a solution for a medium to large scale projects.
- Add bulky features like file attachments.
- Support project management.
